# miRNAgFree

miRNAgFree is a novel microRNA prediction approach based on biogenesis features, such as the known 5' fluctuation, and duplex mean free energies which does not require a genome assembly. We found that, in general, biogenesis related parameters are far more discriminative than duplex related structural parameters.
